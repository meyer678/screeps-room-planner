Room Planner for [Screeps: World](https://screeps.com/), a programming MMO sandbox game.

With this tool a Screeps room layout can be drafted and exported to code as a json object.

### What is Screeps?

In Screeps, players write code to control units and structures using an API.

Players control rooms in part by spawning units (called creeps), harvesting energy sources, and upgrading the room controller object.

A room in Screeps is a closed space of 50x50 cells which connects to other rooms in the game world.

When creep units upgrade a room's controller level, more structures are unlocked that can be constructed and operated using game API functions.

This tool can be useful for Screeps players who want to automate more base-building aspects of their Screeps AI codebase.
